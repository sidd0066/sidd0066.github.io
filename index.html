        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello everyone, my name is Hamid, and I am a gradute from <em>Sir Wilfrid Laurier Secondary School</em> in Ottawa, Canada. When I was in high school, I took a lot of arts and technology courses such as videography, photography, and also graphic design. After graduating high school, I decided to enroll in the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College</p>
        <p>When I heard about the IMD program, I saw that it matches the skills that I already have and also new skills that I want to learn. It also has a lot of opportunities that you can pursue as a career. During quarantine, I started to explore a lot of Adobe programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects and I found that I enjoy using different Adobe programs. Finally, I look forward to learn more about the creative industry and learn new skills in the IMD program. </p>
