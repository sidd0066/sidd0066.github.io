How I created my Web Portfolio:

When I created my Web Portfolio in my User Experience class, I knew I was really happy with the layout that I designed. I knew that the best way to showcase my creative work for a user or future employer was to create separate pages for each portfolio category. I also knew that having each of the categories of my portfolio on my homepage would make it easier for the user to fast click to any of the pages of their choice to view my work. 

Challenges that I faced:

The first challenge I had was when creating the overlay hover effect on my homepage to display the view text for the user to click when hovering on the images. I was luckily able to figure it out with help from the SPA. The second challenge that I had was trying to fix the spacing issue on my contact form, the input of full-name and phone-number which is in the Bootstrap column grid on desktop and tablet, were not spaced well on mobile when they were on top of each other. The solution to fix this issue that I had was to give the phone-number input a margin-top of 1em on the mobile breakpoint and then give it a margin of 0 on the tablet and desktop breakpoints. 

Learning Outcomes: 

I would say one thing I learned when I created my web portfolio is how important it is to make sure that your website is responsive for all screen sizes and functional on all browsers for all users.
