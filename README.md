How I created my web Portfolio:

When I created my Web Portfolio in my User Experience Class, I knew I was really happy the layout that I chose. I felt like knew best way to showcase my creative work for a user was to create separate pages based on each category.  

Challenges that I faced:

The biggest challenge that I faced when making my website was trying to figure out how to create the overlay hover effect on my homepage to display the view text for the user to click when hovering on the images.  

Assets that I used for my homepage:
